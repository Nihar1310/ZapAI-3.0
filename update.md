# ZapAI v2 Implementation Update

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the "Preview → Pay → Enrich" freemium model as outlined in the PRD. The pivot introduces Firecrawl for previews, Stripe for payments, and Apollo for enrichment.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Project Structure Setup

- Added placeholder files for new services and API endpoints
- Set up proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files

### 2. Database Schema Changes
**New Models Created:**
- `app/models/payment.py` - Payment tracking with Stripe integration

  - Status enum: `pending`, `paid`, `failed`
  
- `app/models/cost.py` - Cost tracking per search
  - Fields: `id`, `search_id`, `firecrawl_cost`, `apollo_cost`, `stripe_fee`

**Modified Models:**
- `app/models/search.py` - Updated SearchQuery model
  - Added `status` field with enum: `preview`, `paid`, `enriching`, `ready`, `failed`
